# Asteroids-Clone-Project
This is a project made for a computer science course in high school. It is a clone (in many ways) of the popular Asteroids game. 
The title of this clone is Space Shooter 2015, as that is the year the idea of it was created.

An easy way of running this game is by downloading the files as well as Dr. Java (http://www.drjava.org/), a Java development program. Once downloaded, 
open Dr. Java and navigate to Project -> Open, and select the .drjava file from the files downloaded. Navigate to compile project, click this, then naviagte to and click run project.
