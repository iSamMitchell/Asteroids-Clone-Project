The goal of Space Shooter 2015 is to achieve the highest score! QThis is done by using the spacecraft seen on the title screen. QUsing this spacecraft, you will shoot and destroy asteroids Qthat are flying towards you when playing. The large asteroids Qwill increment your score by 5 points, the medium will increment Qit by 15, and the small will increment it by 25. The game ends Qwhen you are destroyed. The ship is controlled with the arrow Qkeys (excluding the bottom arrow key). The left and right keys Qturn the ship left and right in a circular motion.
